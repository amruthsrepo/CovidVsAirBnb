**Introduction:**

The project is mainly focused on analyzing/discussing how Airbnb or the hotel business in general is affected by Covid-19. The main focus is to see and understand all the factors that affected the retail industry amidst the pandemic.

This calls for combining different datasets and doing a trend analysis. Datasets are needed to be cleaned, analyzed and put into a required form to draw correlations.

The datasets used will be the John Hopkins dataset for covid data and AirBnb dataset for hotel listings. More datasets from the retail sector might be included in the future.

This project will belong to the domains of pandemic and retail.

**Research questions:**

How has the covid-19 pandemic affected the retail industry?

Is there a direct effect on the retail sector from the cases due to the pandemic?

Are there any anomalies in the trends?

Are there any other factors that have affected the retail sector particularly during the pandemic? If yes, what are they? and what are the effects they have had?

**Future work:**

Build a machine learning pipeline that has the capability to combine data from different sources and put it into the required format.

Model the data and perform predictive analysis.

Build an alerting system such that the retail industry can take a look at and make informed decisions.
