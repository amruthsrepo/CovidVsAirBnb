**Introduction:**

Covid-19 has affected every sector across the globe. In this project, we will focus on how
covid-19 affected the hospitality industry.  Our goal is to analyze the effect on the
hospitality industry by processing, exploring, and performing in-depth analyses
of our datasets.
We will be using John Hopkins dataset for covid 19 and the Airbnb dataset for hotel listings. More datasets from other industries will be included in the future. This project will fall into the category of pandemic and hospitality industry.
 
**Research questions:**

1. What is the correlation between covid-19 cases and hotel bookings in California? What does the comparison between the trends look like for the post and pre-pandemic data?
2. Has the number of covid-19 cases affected the pricing of the listings in New york? If yes, what is the correlation?
3. Are there any anomalies in the observed trends in California? If yes, what are the factors that caused this?
 
**Future work:**

Considering datasets from other industries and study the following:

1. The effect of the pandemic on these industries.
2. Studying the correlation between these industries.
